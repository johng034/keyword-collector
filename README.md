# Keyword Collector

## TL;DR
This web app looks for keywords in a job description and checks your resume to see if it includes those keywords.

## Overview
Finding your first job or switching careers is difficult. There are people who send tens or even hundreds of applications before they get their first opportunity. One of the challenges with applying online is the [application tracking system (ATS)](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems). Because of the hundreds of applicants a company receives, an ATS is helpful by reducing the number of applicants to a smaller, more manageable pool.

One way to increase your chances of getting passed the ATS is to include keywords from the job description into your resume. This web application helps you with this by finding the keywords in a job description, reading your resume, and checking which keywords are included in your resume along with which keywords are missing. 

## How to Use the Web App
There are three steps:
1. Copy and paste the job description into the empty field.
2. Upload your resume as a PDF.
3. Submit and check your score.

### Note
I got the idea for this project by using [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/index.php) and [JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/). These are paid services, so my goal was to create my own version and provide it to others for free. Please feel free to provide feedback on what to improve!
