# Keyword Collector

I started this project to help me with job applications. It's important to tailor your resume for each role you apply to. This web app makes it easy to accomplish that by showing you the top 25 most common words in a job description. 

I'm still working on the project. I want to add a feature where a user can upload their resume and have it scanned to compare with the job description (similar to Resume Worded or Jobscan).
